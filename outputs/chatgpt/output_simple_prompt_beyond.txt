### **Functional Requirements**

1. The authoring tool should allow easy modification of the behavior of user interfaces.
2. The authoring tool should support easy development of adaptive user interfaces.
3. The authoring tool should enable the functional requirements specification of next-generation consumer products in a faster and more efficient manner.
4. The system should have an intelligent software layer where the User Interface is user-definable.
5. The firmware structure should support adding a UI interpreter to interpret and visualize UI code.
6. The UI editor should include a simulation module to test the system offline before deployment.

### **Non-Functional Requirements**

1. The authoring tool should be efficient in modifying and developing UI elements.
2. The system should ensure usability, allowing easy interaction for users.
3. The UI interpreter should work seamlessly with the UI editor for smooth visualization.
4. The simulation module should provide accurate and reliable results before deployment.
5. The authoring tool should be suitable for consumer product constraints.
6. The system should enhance productivity in UI design and development.

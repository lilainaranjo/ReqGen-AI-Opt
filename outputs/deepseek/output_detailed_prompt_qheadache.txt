### **Functional Requirements**  
**1. User Interface (UI)**  
- **1.1 Display Requirements**:  
  - The game must render in a minimum resolution of **800x600 pixels** but should scale dynamically to higher resolutions (e.g., 1920x1080).  
  - Example: If the user’s display is 1024x768, the game will auto-adjust UI elements proportionally.  
  - If the resolution is below 800x600, the game displays an error: “Resolution unsupported. Please set to 800x600 or higher.”  

- **1.2 Graphical Elements**:  
  - Use non-flashing, low-contrast visuals (e.g., pastel colors, minimal animations) to avoid triggering headaches or eye strain.  
  - Example: Puzzle pieces fade into place instead of flickering.  

- **1.3 Menus**:  
  - **Main Menu**: Options include “New Game,” “Difficulty Settings,” “Help,” “Sound Settings,” and “Exit.”  
  - **In-Game Menu**: Accessible via the **Esc** key, with “Resume,” “Restart,” “Settings,” and “Quit to Main Menu.”  
  - All menus are navigable via mouse clicks or keyboard arrows + **Enter**.  

- **1.4 Sound**:  
  - Adjustable volume sliders for background music and sound effects (0-100%).  
  - Default sound: Calming instrumental music and soft feedback tones (e.g., a chime for correct answers).  

**2. Input Handling**  
- **2.1 Mouse Interaction**:  
  - Primary actions (e.g., selecting menu items, dragging puzzle pieces) use the **left mouse button**.  
  - Right-clicking a puzzle piece provides a hint (e.g., rotates the piece).  

- **2.2 Keyboard Shortcuts**:  
  - **Esc**: Pause/access menu.  
  - **F1**: Open help documentation.  
  - **Ctrl + S**: Quick-save progress (saved locally to `%AppData%/GameName/savefile.dat`).  

**3. Game Mechanics**  
- **3.1 Objective**: Solve puzzles to distract from headaches.  
  - Example puzzles:  
    - **Matching Shapes**: Pair geometric shapes under time limits.  
    - **Word Completion**: Fill in missing letters in calming nature-themed words (e.g., “FOR_EST”).  

- **3.2 Difficulty Levels**:  
  - **Beginner (Age 8+)**: Puzzles with 4-6 pieces, unlimited time.  
  - **Advanced (Adult)**: Puzzles with 15-20 pieces, 30-second time limits.  

- **3.3 Progress Tracking**:  
  - Local save files track completed puzzles and high scores.  

**4. Accessibility**  
- **4.1 Subtitles**: All audio cues (e.g., “Correct!”) have optional text displays.  
- **4.2 Colorblind Mode**: Toggleable in settings (e.g., shapes use patterns instead of colors).  

**5. Help System**  
- **5.1 Tutorial**: A guided walkthrough for first-time users (skippable).  
- **5.2 In-Game Hints**: Hints regenerate every 60 seconds if the player is stuck.

### **Non-Functional Requirements**  
**1. Performance**  
- **1.1 Responsiveness**: All user inputs (clicks, keystrokes) must register within **200ms**.  
- **1.2 Load Times**: The game launches within **5 seconds** on hardware meeting minimum specs.  

**2. Usability**  
- **2.1 Learnability**: A first-time user (age 8) should complete the tutorial and solve a beginner puzzle within **10 minutes**.  
- **2.2 Error Handling**: Invalid inputs (e.g., clicking outside interactive areas) trigger a gentle error sound but no UI disruption.  

**3. Compatibility**  
- **3.1 Operating Systems**: Supports Windows 10+, macOS 12+, and Ubuntu 22.04+.  
- **3.2 Hardware**: Requires a **mouse with a scroll wheel** and a **keyboard with at least 104 keys**.  

**4. Security**  
- **4.1 Data Privacy**: No user data (e.g., save files) is transmitted online.  

**5. Scalability**  
- **5.1 Localization**: UI text is stored in external files (e.g., `lang_en.json`) to support future translations.  

---

### **Assumptions and Examples**  
- **Assumption 1**: “Solve a specific headache” refers to using cognitive distraction via puzzles.  
  - Example: A player with a tension headache focuses on matching shapes, reducing perceived pain.  
- **Assumption 2**: Time limits for advanced puzzles are **30 seconds** unless specified otherwise.  
- **Assumption 3**: The game is installed locally; no cloud saves or multiplayer features.  

---

### **Edge Cases and Testing Scenarios**  
- **Case 1**: User attempts to run the game at 640x480 resolution.  
  - **Expected**: Error message blocks startup until resolution is adjusted.  
- **Case 2**: Player loses internet connectivity during play.  
  - **Expected**: No impact (game operates offline).  
- **Case 3**: A colorblind user toggles accessibility mode.  
  - **Expected**: Shapes display with striped/dotted patterns.

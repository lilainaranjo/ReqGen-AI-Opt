Based on the provided system description for the **Space Fractions** project, here's a clear breakdown of functional and non-functional requirements:

---

### **Functional Requirements**  
*(What the system must do)*  
1. **Deliver a fraction-solving educational game**:  
   - Provide interactive gameplay focused on sixth-grade fraction problems.  
2. **Generate performance-based feedback**:  
   - Calculate player scores during gameplay and deliver tailored feedback upon game completion.  
3. **Host a central game menu ("umbrella")**:  
   - Offer a web-based interface to access multiple games.  
4. **Enable game selection**:  
   - Allow users to choose and launch games from the central menu.  
5. **Support web-based access**:  
   - Ensure all components (game and menu) are accessible via web browsers.

### **Non-Functional Requirements**  
*(How the system should perform)*  
1. **Usability**:  
   - Interface must be intuitive for sixth-grade students (e.g., simple navigation, age-appropriate language).  
2. **Accessibility**:  
   - Web-based design must ensure cross-device compatibility (desktops, tablets).  
3. **Performance**:  
   - Responsive gameplay with minimal latency to maintain engagement.  
4. **Scalability**:  
   - Menu system ("umbrella") must support adding/removing games without disrupting core functionality.  
5. **Educational Effectiveness**:  
   - Feedback mechanism must meaningfully correlate with player scores to support learning objectives.  
6. **Reliability**:  
   - Stable operation during gameplay and score calculation to prevent data loss or interruptions.

### **Key Inferences from the Description**  
- **Scope**: The system comprises two main components:  
  - A fraction-solving game with scoring/feedback.  
  - A centralized menu ("umbrella") for game selection.  
- **Target Audience**: Sixth-grade students → Influences usability and content complexity.  
- **Technical Foundation**: Web-based → Dictates compatibility and accessibility requirements.  
- **Future-Proofing**: "Umbrella" implies extensibility for additional games (scalability).  

This extraction aligns with the project’s goal of creating an engaging, educational tool while addressing technical and user experience constraints.

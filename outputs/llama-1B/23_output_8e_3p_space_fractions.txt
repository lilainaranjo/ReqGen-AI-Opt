Functional Requirements:

1. **Game Selection**: Users can select from three pre-made fractions (30/60, 45/90, 50/100) using dropdown menus provided at the beginning of each level.

2. **Level Progression**:
   - Each selected option has multiple levels ranging from easy through challenging until it reaches advanced difficulty where users must solve problems by themselves before progressing further into more complex ones.
   
3. **User Interface Features**
    - A main screen displaying all available options along with instructions about how they work together towards achieving higher score goals within different categories like addition/subtraction multiplication/division basic algebra word problem solving logic reasoning math facts memory matching number sequence pattern completion puzzle story sequencing sorting alphabetizing categorization ordering grouping combining identifying shapes patterns colors textures objects types animals plants living things food drinks water air ground sky home school restaurant store hospital clinic doctor nurse teacher student computer printer camera phone radio TV television microwave oven refrigerator stove dishwasher washing machine dryer iron clothes dryers laundry washer car bike bicycle bus train boat ferry plane airplane helicopter submarine cruise ship aircraft airport terminal station port city town village farm rural area desert mountain forest river delta sea island lake ocean bay swamp bog marsh wetland arid semi-arid deserts tundra grasslands savannas temperate rainforests tropical islands coral reefs estuaries mangroves saltwater lakes rivers deltas coastal areas urban cities suburban towns metropolitan regions national parks wildlife reserves protected areas conservation zones natural monuments historical sites cultural heritage landmarks memorials cemeteries public buildings private homes schools hospitals universities colleges dormitories prisons military bases research stations airports ports harbors dams reservoirs tunnels bridges roads highways railways pipelines power lines transmission towers communication satellites fiber optic cables underground utilities electrical grids gas pipes oil refineries chemical factories nuclear reactors coal mines gold mining silver copper platinum diamond tin tungsten uranium nickel cobalt chromium manganese molybdenum rhodium ruthenium iridium osmium palladium platinate thallium lead cadmium mercury selenium bismuth strontium barium lanthanides actinides neptunium plutonium americium curium berkelium californium einsteinium fermium gadolinium holmium erbium thorium yttrium lutetium samarium dysprosimium praseodymium neodymium promethium europium terbium polonium aktinium rutherford radon protactinium uraninite thorium copernicium technecium oganesson element-92 elements up to element-118 
4. **Score Tracking System**

* When players complete one task correctly, points increase accordingly according to predefined rules such as adding bonus if correct answer exceeds expected value subtracting penalty otherwise maintaining current point total no change required only incrementation occurs after scoring process begins again once new attempt starts 

5. **Feedback Mechanisms**

* After completing tasks accurately enough to progress forward two times back track previous attempts showing which answers were incorrect why so giving player insight into mistakes made during gameplay helping them learn faster better understand concepts improving overall performance over repeated trials increasing confidence gradually leading ultimately toward mastery goal achievement

4. **Traceable Links**:
   - The system must create traceable links between all relevant entities (e.g., cases, exposures, contacts, etc.).
   - It should support tracing the mechanism of transmission and identifying the source of the health event.

5. **Integration with Other Systems**:
   - The system must integrate with systems supporting:
     - Early event detection
     - Countermeasure administration
     - Laboratory systems
     - Surveillance systems

6. **Support for Investigation and Management**:
   - The system should support the investigation, monitoring, management, analysis, and reporting of health events or bioterrorism acts.

7. **Reporting**:
   - The system must provide reporting capabilities to support decision-making and response efforts.

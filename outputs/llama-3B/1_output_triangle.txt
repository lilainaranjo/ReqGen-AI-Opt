**Functional Requirements:**

1. **Game Selection**: The system shall allow users to select from three pre-defined games: Constructing, Transforming, and Marking. New games can be added to the system without modifying the original code.
2. **Game Mode**: The system shall support two game modes: Solo and Multiplayer. In Solo mode, the system shall generate a random triangular grid and allow the user to play against the system. In Multiplayer mode, the system shall allow two users to play against each other.
3. **Grid Generation**: The system shall generate a random triangular grid for each game. The grid shall consist of a set of vertices and edges, with each vertex connected to two edges.
4. **Gameplay**: The system shall allow users to place lines or dots on the grid, with the goal of preventing their opponent from completing a path while also trying to complete their own.
5. **Path Completion**: The system shall detect when a player completes a path and notify the opponent.
6. **User Input**: The system shall accept user input through a graphical user interface (GUI) that is mainly mouse-controlled but may also be used with a keyboard.
7. **Game State Management**: The system shall manage the game state, including the current player, the grid, and the game history.
8. **Game Over**: The system shall determine when a game is over, either when a player completes a path or when a predetermined number of moves have been made.

**Non-Functional Requirements:**

1. **Performance**: The system shall be able to generate and render a triangular grid with a reasonable number of vertices and edges within a reasonable time frame.
2. **Scalability**: The system shall be able to handle a large number of users and games without significant performance degradation.
3. **Usability**: The system shall have an intuitive GUI that is easy to use, with clear and concise instructions and feedback.
4. **Security**: The system shall ensure that user input is validated and sanitized to prevent security vulnerabilities.
5. **Reliability**: The system shall be able to recover from errors and exceptions without data loss or corruption.
6. **Maintainability**: The system shall be designed with modularity and extensibility in mind, making it easy to add new games and features without modifying the original code.
7. **Portability**: The system shall be able to run on multiple different environments without modification to the code, thanks to the Java platform.

**Assumptions and Examples:**

1. **Time**: The system shall generate a new triangular grid for each game, with a reasonable number of vertices and edges. For example, a grid with 10 vertices and 15 edges shall be generated for a game of Constructing.
2. **Conditions**: The system shall detect when a player completes a path, regardless of the specific conditions of the game. For example, in a game of Constructing, the system shall detect when a player completes a path by connecting three vertices.
3. **Device Connections**: The system shall use a standard mouse and keyboard connection, with no additional hardware required.
4. **User Input**: The system shall accept mouse clicks and keyboard input, with the ability to select a vertex or edge on the grid by clicking on it.
5. **Game State Management**: The system shall store the game state in memory, including the current player, the grid, and the game history. For example, the system shall store the current player as a variable, the grid as a data structure, and the game history as a list of moves.

**Implementation Details:**

1. **Java Platform**: The system shall be implemented using the Java platform, with a focus on modularity and extensibility.
2. **GUI**: The system shall use a standard GUI library, such as Swing or JavaFX, to create a user-friendly interface.
3. **Game Logic**: The system shall use a game logic library, such as Java's built-in `java.util` package, to manage the game state and detect path completion.
4. **Data Structures**: The system shall use data structures, such as arrays and lists, to store the game state and game history.
5. **Error Handling**: The system shall use try-catch blocks and error handling mechanisms to handle errors and exceptions, ensuring that the system remains reliable and secure.

**Example Code:**

Here is an example of how the system might be implemented in Java:
```java
import java.awt.*;
import java.awt.event.*;
import java.util.*;

public class TriangularGames {
    private JFrame frame;
    private JPanel panel;
    private Grid grid;
    private Player player;
    private Game game;

    public TriangularGames() {
        frame = new JFrame("Triangular Games");
        frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);
        frame.setSize(800, 600);

        panel = new JPanel();
        panel.setLayout(new BorderLayout());

        grid = new Grid(10, 15);
        panel.add(grid, BorderLayout.CENTER);

        player = new Player();
        panel.add(player, BorderLayout.NORTH);

        game = new Game();
        panel.add(game, BorderLayout.SOUTH);

        frame.add(panel);
        frame.setVisible(true);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        new TriangularGames();
    }
}

class Grid {
    private int vertices;
    private int edges;
    private Vertex[] vertices;

    public Grid(int vertices, int edges) {
        this.vertices = vertices;
        this.edges = edges;
        this.vertices = new Vertex[vertices];
        for (int i = 0; i < vertices; i++) {
            vertices[i] = new Vertex(i);
        }
    }

    public void draw() {
        // Draw the grid
    }
}

class Vertex {
    private int index;

    public Vertex(int index) {
        this.index = index;
    }

    public void draw() {
        // Draw the vertex
    }
}

class Player {
    private int index;

    public Player() {
        this.index = 0;
    }

    public void draw() {
        // Draw the player
    }
}

class Game {
    private int moves;

    public Game() {
        this.moves = 0;
    }

    public void draw() {
        // Draw the game state
    }

    public void update() {
        // Update the game state
    }
}
```
This example code provides a basic structure for the system, including a GUI, game logic, and data structures. However, it is just a starting point, and additional features and functionality will need to be added to complete the system.

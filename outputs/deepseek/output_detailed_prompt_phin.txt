### **Public Health Information Network (PHIN) Outbreak Management (OM) System Requirements**  
This document defines functional and non-functional requirements for implementing an OM system, including assumptions and examples to resolve ambiguities.  

---

### **Functional Requirements**  

#### **1. Data Collection & Management**  
- **Case Management**:  
  - Capture demographics (name, age, gender, address), symptoms (fever, cough, onset date), status (suspected/confirmed/resolved), and risk factors (e.g., pre-existing conditions).  
  - *Example*: A user must input a confirmed COVID-19 case with symptom onset date ≤14 days from lab confirmation.  

- **Contact Tracing**:  
  - Record contacts (name, relationship to case, exposure date/duration), and automatically flag high-risk contacts (e.g., >15 minutes unmasked interaction).  
  - *Example*: Link a measles case to three daycare contacts exposed on 2023-10-05.  

- **Exposure Tracking**:  
  - Log locations (GPS coordinates, venue type), dates/times, and transmission mechanisms (airborne, direct contact).  
  - *Example*: A norovirus outbreak traced to a restaurant on 2023-09-20 between 12:00–14:00.  

- **Specimen/Sample Management**:  
  - Track clinical/environmental specimens (ID, collection date, source, chain of custody).  
  - *Example*: Water sample #WS-2023-001 from a contaminated well, collected 2023-10-01, sent to Lab X.  

- **Lab Integration**:  
  - Receive results (e.g., PCR positive/negative, variant type) via HL7/FHIR within 24 hours of processing.  

- **Vaccination/Treatment Tracking**:  
  - Record doses (vaccine type, date, lot number), treatments (antivirals, antibiotics), and adverse reactions.  

- **Travel/Conveyance History**:  
  - Document travel routes (flight numbers, seating), dates, and transportation modes (air, cruise).  

- **Dynamic Data Objects**:  
  - Allow admins to create new fields/forms during investigations (e.g., adding "Ebola viral load" via a no-code UI).  

#### **2. Analysis & Reporting**  
- **Statistical Tools**:  
  - Calculate attack rates, temporal trends, and spatial clusters (heatmaps).  
  - *Example*: A 30% attack rate among unvaccinated attendees of Event Y.  

- **Link Analysis Visualization**:  
  - Generate network graphs to trace transmission chains (e.g., Case A → Contact B → Case C).  

- **Automated Alerts**:  
  - Trigger notifications when thresholds are exceeded (e.g., >100 cholera cases/week in Region Z).  

- **Exportable Reports**:  
  - Generate PDF/CSV reports for public health authorities (e.g., WHO-formatted outbreak summaries).  

#### **3. Integration**  
- **Early Event Detection**:  
  - Receive real-time alerts from surveillance systems (e.g., syndromic surveillance spikes).  

- **Countermeasure Systems**:  
  - Share data with inventory systems to track vaccine/treatment stockpiles.  

- **Interoperability**:  
  - Support HL7/FHIR for lab data and JSON/XML for cross-system alerts.  

#### **4. Configuration & Flexibility**  
- **Event-Specific Templates**:  
  - Preconfigure workflows for diseases (e.g., tuberculosis vs. chemical exposure).  

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**:  
  - Define roles (investigator, lab tech, admin) with permissions (e.g., lab techs cannot view patient addresses).  

---

### **Non-Functional Requirements**  

#### **1. Performance**  
- Support 10,000 concurrent users during peak outbreaks.  
- Data entry response time <2 seconds.  
- Lab result processing within 24 hours of submission.  

#### **2. Security**  
- Encrypt data in transit (TLS 1.3+) and at rest (AES-256).  
- Audit logs for all data accesses/modifications.  
- Compliance with HIPAA (US) and GDPR (EU).  

#### **3. Usability**  
- Multilingual interfaces (English, Spanish, French).  
- Mobile-responsive design with offline sync for field workers.  

#### **4. Reliability**  
- 99.9% uptime (excluding scheduled maintenance).  
- Disaster recovery within 24 hours (geo-redundant backups).  

#### **5. Scalability**  
- Auto-scale cloud infrastructure (AWS/Azure) during outbreaks.  

#### **6. Interoperability**  
- HL7/FHIR for lab systems; REST APIs for external integrations.

### **Assumptions & Examples**  
1. **Offline Functionality**:  
   - Users in remote areas can input data offline; changes sync when connectivity resumes.  

2. **Data Retention**:  
   - Retain records for 10 years unless legal requirements dictate otherwise.  

3. **Training**:  
   - Mandatory training modules for RBAC roles (e.g., 4-hour course for investigators).  

4. **Testing**:  
   - Annual penetration testing and load testing (simulate 20,000 concurrent users).  

5. **Threshold Examples**:  
   - Alert triggers: >50 cases in 48 hours, >5 fatalities in a week.

### **Implementation Guidance**  
- Use modular architecture (microservices) for flexibility.  
- Prioritize user testing with public health workers during pilot phases.  
- Provide API documentation for external partners (e.g., labs, hospitals).  

This specification ensures clarity, reduces ambiguity, and aligns with PHIN’s mission to mitigate health events effectively.

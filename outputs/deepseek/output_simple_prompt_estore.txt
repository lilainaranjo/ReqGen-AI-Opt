Based on the provided system description, here's a structured breakdown of the **functional requirements (FR)** and **non-functional requirements (NFR)**:

---

### **Functional Requirements (FR)**  
*(What the system must do)*  

1. **Product Management**  
   - FR1: Allow configuration of products (customizable attributes).  
   - FR2: Display comprehensive product details (e.g., descriptions, specifications, pricing).  
   - FR3: Categorize products into hierarchical groups.  

2. **Search & Navigation**  
   - FR4: Provide a search facility for products.  
   - FR5: Generate a detailed sitemap for navigation.  

3. **User Management**  
   - FR6: Support customer profile creation/management.  
   - FR7: Offer personalization options (e.g., recommendations, saved preferences).  

4. **Shopping & Ordering**  
   - FR8: Provide a shopping cart for item aggregation.  
   - FR9: Support multiple shipping methods (e.g., standard, express).  
   - FR10: Calculate taxes dynamically during checkout.  
   - FR11: Support multiple payment methods (e.g., credit card, PayPal).  
   - FR12: Allow online order modification or cancellation.  
   - FR13: Send automated email confirmations (e.g., order receipts, shipping updates).  

5. **Post-Purchase Features**  
   - FR14: Enable online shipment tracking.  
   - FR15: Allow customers to submit product reviews and ratings.  

6. **Promotions & Support**  
   - FR16: Offer online promotions, rewards, and financing options.  
   - FR17: Provide customer support (e.g., chat, FAQs, contact forms).

### **Non-Functional Requirements (NFR)**  
*(How the system should perform)*  

1. **Usability**  
   - NFR1: Intuitive navigation (supported by sitemap, search, and categorization).  
   - NFR2: Personalization features must adapt to user preferences with minimal manual input.  

2. **Reliability**  
   - NFR3: Ensure accurate tax calculations across regions.  
   - NFR4: Guarantee successful order processing and email confirmations.  
   - NFR5: Maintain real-time accuracy in shipment tracking.  

3. **Performance**  
   - NFR6: Fast search results with relevant product listings.  
   - NFR7: Responsive checkout process (e.g., <3-second load times).  

4. **Security**  
   - NFR8: Secure payment processing (PCI-DSS compliance).  
   - NFR9: Protect customer profiles and personal data (e.g., encryption).  

5. **Scalability**  
   - NFR10: Handle high traffic during promotions or peak sales.  

6. **Maintainability**  
   - NFR11: Modular design to support updates (e.g., adding new payment/shipping methods).  

7. **Compliance**  
   - NFR12: Adhere to regional tax regulations.  
   - NFR13: Comply with data privacy laws (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).

### **Key Observations**  
- **Functional requirements** focus on user actions (e.g., searching, purchasing, reviewing) and system capabilities (e.g., tax calculation, email automation).  
- **Non-functional requirements** emphasize quality attributes like security, speed, reliability, and adaptability to ensure a seamless user experience.  
- Implicit NFRs (e.g., **availability** for 24/7 access, **error tolerance** for payment failures) are inferred from the e-commerce context but not explicitly stated.  

This extraction aligns with industry standards (e.g., ISO/IEC 25010 for NFRs) and best practices for e-commerce systems.

**Functional Requirements**

1. **Game Selection**: 
    - Users can select from three different fractions games (e.g., "Fraction War," "Addition Game," and "Comparison").
    - Each game has its own set of rules and objectives.

2. **User Authentication**:
    - A new account must be created before playing the first game.
    - Existing users can log into their accounts using their username and password.
    - Passwords must meet certain criteria (length, complexity).

3. **Umbrella Menu System**:
    - After completing all available games, players return to the main page where they have access to play again or view previous results.
    - Players can navigate through the options by clicking buttons labeled 'Play Again' or 'View Results'.

4. **Feedback Display**:
    - When the player completes each level within a selected game, display their score along with instructions on how many more levels they need to complete to achieve perfection.
    - Provide detailed explanations about what went wrong during gameplay if needed.

5. **Score Tracking**:
    - Keep track of every single attempt made throughout the entire course.
    - Allow multiple attempts per question.
    - Store data locally so it persists even after closing the browser window.

6. **Error Handling**:
    - Handle cases such as invalid input fields, missing required values, incorrect passwords, etc.
    - Inform the user which field was empty or why their login credentials were rejected.

7. **Data Storage**:
    - All student progress and test results will be stored securely online via our server-side database.
    - Data storage includes usernames, email addresses, IP addresses, timestamps, scores, answers provided, questions attempted, correct/incorrect status, total number of attempts, completion percentage, etc.

8. **Progression**:
    - Track whether the student completed a particular lesson successfully or failed at some point.
    - Record the date/time the task was started and finished.
    - Update the student's overall performance metrics accordingly.

9. **Accessibility Features**:
    - Ensure compatibility across various devices including desktop computers, laptops, tablets, smartphones, etc.
    - Implement keyboard navigation support for visually impaired users.
    - Include high contrast mode option for colorblind individuals.

10. **Security Measures**:
    - Protect against unauthorized access to sensitive areas like personal profiles, test history, etc.
    - Use HTTPS encryption protocol to secure communication between client-server applications.
    - Regularly update software components to prevent exploitation vulnerabilities.

11. **System Maintenance**:
    - Schedule regular maintenance sessions to ensure optimal system operation.
    - Perform backups daily to minimize loss due to hardware failure or other unforeseen events.
    - Monitor logs regularly to detect suspicious activity.

12. **Reporting Functionality**:
    - Generate reports detailing individual student performance over time.
    - Create graphs showing trends in student improvement/success rates.
    - Export report data to CSV files for further analysis.

13. **Notification System**:
    - Send notifications to registered users whenever significant updates occur (new content added).
    - Offer reminders regarding upcoming deadlines/test dates.

14. **Help Section**:
    - Develop comprehensive documentation covering key features, usage guidelines, troubleshooting tips, FAQs, technical specifications, licensing agreements, terms of service, contact details, copyright notices, disclaimers, privacy policy statements, security policies, accessibility statement, etc.

15. **Testing Environment Setup**:
    - Set up testing environment with sample data to verify functionality under normal operating conditions.
    - Test application thoroughly to identify bugs, errors, inconsistencies, logical flaws, usability issues, etc.
    - Document findings, propose solutions, implement fixes, retest until no defects remain.

16. **Deployment Strategy**:
    - Plan deployment strategy considering factors like scalability, reliability, maintainability, cost-effectiveness, ease of use, flexibility, adaptability, responsiveness, speed, efficiency, effectiveness, impact, sustainability, innovation, creativity, collaboration, teamwork, leadership, vision, mission, goals, objectives, outcomes, benefits, challenges, risks, opportunities,

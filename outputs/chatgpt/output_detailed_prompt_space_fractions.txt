To successfully implement the **Space Fractions** project and its associated umbrella system, we will distill the system description into **complete and unambiguous functional and non-functional requirements**, along with assumptions and concrete examples to eliminate vagueness. These will guide developers, designers, and testers.

---

# ‚úÖ **Functional Requirements (FR)**

## üß© 1. Game Functionality ‚Äì ‚ÄúSpace Fractions‚Äù

### FR1.1: Game Type

* The system shall implement an **interactive, web-based game** designed to teach and reinforce **fraction-solving skills** appropriate for **sixth-grade students (ages \~11‚Äì12)**.

### FR1.2: Gameplay Mechanics

* The game shall present **fraction problems** (e.g., simplify 4/8, convert improper to mixed fractions, add/subtract/multiply/divide fractions).
* The system shall offer **visual aids**, such as fraction circles, bars, or number lines.
* Students shall interact using:

  * Mouse clicks (e.g., to select answers or move characters)
  * Keyboard input (e.g., to type numerical answers or navigate)

#### Assumption A1:

* Each game session consists of **10 questions** chosen randomly from a question bank.
* The bank contains at least **50 unique problems**.

### FR1.3: Game Theme and Engagement

* The system shall use a **space theme** (e.g., planets, rockets, astronauts).
* Correct answers shall advance the user in a space-themed journey (e.g., visiting a new planet).
* Incorrect answers shall trigger feedback or opportunities to retry.

### FR1.4: Scoring and Feedback

* Each correct answer gives **10 points**, totaling a max of 100.
* At game end, system shall display:

  * Total score (0‚Äì100)
  * Number of correct/incorrect answers
  * Time taken (formatted as mm\:ss)
  * Encouraging message based on performance:

    * 90‚Äì100: "Outstanding Astronaut!"
    * 70‚Äì89: "Great Job, Space Explorer!"
    * 50‚Äì69: "Keep Practicing, Cadet!"
    * <50: "Don't Give Up! Try Again!"

#### Assumption A2:

* The feedback screen also includes **a ‚ÄòPlay Again‚Äô and ‚ÄòReturn to Menu‚Äô button**.

### FR1.5: Game Access

* The game shall be **accessible from standard desktop and tablet browsers**.

---

## üóÇÔ∏è 2. Umbrella Menu System

### FR2.1: Web-Based Menu Interface

* The umbrella system shall be a **web-based menu**.
* It shall list **all games created previously**, including Space Fractions.
* Each game shall be represented with:

  * A title (e.g., "Space Fractions")
  * A thumbnail image
  * A short description (max 100 characters)
  * A ‚ÄúPlay‚Äù button

### FR2.2: Game Launch

* Clicking "Play" launches the selected game in **the same browser window** or a **new tab**, depending on configuration.

#### Assumption A3:

* A simple configuration option (e.g., setting in a JSON config or admin panel) controls whether the game opens in a new tab or not.

### FR2.3: Responsive Design

* The menu system shall support **responsive layouts** for devices including:

  * Desktops (min 1024px width)
  * Tablets (min 768px width)

---

## üõ°Ô∏è 3. User Experience and Accessibility

### FR3.1: Accessibility Compliance

* The system shall conform to **WCAG 2.1 Level AA** accessibility standards:

  * All text shall have sufficient contrast
  * All interactions shall be accessible via keyboard navigation
  * ARIA labels shall be used for screen reader compatibility

### FR3.2: Audio Feedback (Optional)

* The game shall play **simple sound effects**:

  * Correct/incorrect answer
  * Game completion

#### Assumption A4:

* A mute/unmute toggle is available in-game.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è 4. Configuration and Extensibility

### FR4.1: Game List Configuration

* The umbrella system shall retrieve the list of available games from a **JSON file or database**.
* Each game entry includes:

  ```json
  {
    "id": "space_fractions",
    "title": "Space Fractions",
    "description": "Solve space-themed fraction challenges!",
    "thumbnail": "images/space_fractions_thumb.png",
    "url": "games/space_fractions/index.html"
  }
  ```

### FR4.2: Adding New Games

* New games can be added without code changes, by updating the configuration.

---

# ‚ùå Non-Functional Requirements (NFR)

## üåê NFR1: Platform and Technology

* The product shall be implemented using **HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript**.
* Frameworks such as **React**, **Vue.js**, or **Vanilla JS** may be used.
* Backend (if used for configuration or score tracking) shall use **Node.js with Express** or **a static hosting approach (e.g., GitHub Pages)**.

## üì± NFR2: Performance

* The menu system shall load in **<2 seconds** on a standard broadband connection (5 Mbps).
* Each game shall load in **<3 seconds** under the same conditions.

## üîí NFR3: Security

* The site shall use **HTTPS**.
* Input validation must prevent XSS and injection attacks.
* No sensitive data is collected; compliance with **COPPA** is still advised if targeting children under 13.

## üß™ NFR4: Testability

* The system shall include:

  * **Unit tests** for game logic
  * **Integration tests** for menu and navigation
  * **User acceptance tests (UAT)** for core workflows

## üåç NFR5: Internationalization

* All game content and UI labels shall be defined in a language file to allow for future **multi-language support**.

# üìù Example Usage Flow

1. A student accesses `https://learnfractions.com/menu`.
2. They see:

   * Space Fractions
   * Galaxy Geometry (example past game)
3. They click "Play" on Space Fractions.
4. Game starts, displays instructions.
5. They solve 10 fraction problems.
6. They see a score of 80, with feedback: "Great Job, Space Explorer!"
7. They click "Return to Menu".

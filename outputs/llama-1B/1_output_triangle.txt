**Functional Requirements**

1. **Triangulation Game Implementation**
	* The system should be able to create a new game with the following features:
		+ Three sides of the triangular grid
		+ Players take turns placing lines or dots on the grid
		+ The objective is to create a path that connects three sides of the grid
		+ The game should prevent the opponent from completing a path while trying to complete one's own
	* The system should be able to handle multiple games simultaneously
	* The system should be able to automatically select the game type (constructing, transforming, or marking) when a new game is started
2. **User Interface**
	* The system should have a graphical user interface (GUI) that is mainly mouse-controlled but can also be used with a keyboard
	* The GUI should display the current game state, including the grid and the player's moves
	* The system should be able to display the game over message when the game is finished
3. **Game Selection**
	* The system should be able to automatically select the game type when a new game is started
	* The system should be able to display the available game types (constructing, transforming, or marking) to the user
4. **Gameplay**
	* The system should allow players to place lines or dots on the grid
	* The system should prevent the opponent from completing a path while trying to complete one's own
	* The system should keep track of the game state and update it accordingly
5. **Game Over**
	* The system should display the game over message when the game is finished
	* The system should keep track of the game history and display it to the user

**Non-Functional Requirements**

1. **Performance**
	* The system should be able to handle multiple games simultaneously without significant performance degradation
	* The system should be able to handle large grids without significant performance degradation
2. **Scalability**
	* The system should be able to handle a large number of users without significant performance degradation
	* The system should be able to handle a large number of games simultaneously without significant performance degradation
3. **Security**
	* The system should be able to prevent unauthorized access to the game data
	* The system should be able to prevent data corruption or loss
4. **Usability**
	* The system should be easy to use and navigate for the user
	* The system should provide clear and concise instructions for the user
5. **Maintainability**
	* The system should be easy to modify and update without significant changes to the code
	* The system should be easy to debug and troubleshoot

**Assumptions and Examples**

* The system assumes that the user will place lines or dots on the grid in a way that creates a path that connects three sides of the grid.
* The system assumes that the user will try to prevent their opponent from completing a path while trying to complete their own.
* The system assumes that the game will be played for a finite number of moves, and that the game will end when one player has completed a path or blocked their opponent from completing a path.
* The system assumes that the user will use the GUI to control the game, and that the system will automatically select the game type when a new game is started.

**Example Code**

Here is an example of how the system might be implemented in Java:
```java
import javax.swing.*;
import java.awt.*;
import java.awt.event.*;

public class TriangulationGame extends JPanel {
  private int[][] grid;
  private int playerTurn;
  private String gameType;

  public TriangulationGame() {
    setLayout(new BorderLayout());
    grid = new int[3][3];
    playerTurn = 0;
    gameType = "constructing";
  }

  public void paintComponent(Graphics g) {
    super.paintComponent(g);
    for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
      for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
        if (grid[i][j] == 1) {
          g.setColor(Color.BLACK);
          g.fillRect(j * 50, i * 50, 50, 50);
        } else if (grid[i][j] == 2) {
          g.setColor(Color.WHITE);
          g.fillRect(j * 50, i * 50, 50, 50);
        }
      }
    }
  }

  public void handleMouseMotion(MouseEvent e) {
    if (playerTurn == 0) {
      int x = e.getX() / 50;
      int y = e.getY() / 50;
      if (grid[y][x] == 1) {
        grid[y][x] = 2;
        if (playerTurn == 1) {
          playerTurn = 0;
        } else {
          playerTurn = 1;
        }
      }
    }
  }

  public void handleMousePressed(MouseEvent e) {
    if (playerTurn == 0) {
      int x = e.getX() / 50;
      int y = e.getY() / 50;
      if (grid[y][x] == 1) {
        grid[y][x] = 2;
        if (playerTurn == 1) {
          playerTurn = 0;
        } else {
          playerTurn = 1;
        }
      }
    }
  }

  public void handleMouseReleased(MouseEvent e) {
    if (playerTurn == 0) {
      int x = e.getX() / 50;
      int y = e.getY() / 50;
      if (grid[y][x] == 1) {
        grid[y][x] = 1;
        if (playerTurn == 1) {
          playerTurn = 0;
        } else {
          playerTurn = 1;
        }
      }
    }
  }

  public void startGame() {
    playerTurn = 0;
    gameType = "constructing";
    repaint();
  }

  public void endGame() {
    playerTurn = 1;
    repaint();
  }

  public void selectGameType(String type) {
    gameType = type;
  }

  public static void main(String[] args) {
    JFrame frame = new JFrame("Triangulation Game");
    frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE);
    frame.add(new TriangulationGame());
    frame.setSize(300, 300);
    frame.setVisible(true);
    frame.startGame();
  }
}
```
This is just one possible implementation of the system, and there are many ways to implement it. The key is to create a system that is easy to use and navigate, and that provides clear and concise instructions for the user.

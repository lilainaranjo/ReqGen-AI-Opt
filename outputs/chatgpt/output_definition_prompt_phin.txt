Here are the extracted **functional** and **non-functional** requirements from the given system description:

### **Functional Requirements** (What the system must do)

1. The system must support the investigation, monitoring, management, analysis, and reporting of health events and bioterrorism acts.
2. It should collect and analyze data to aid in identifying and containing a health event.
3. The system must be configurable to meet the needs of different types of health events.
4. It should capture and store data related to:

   * Cases
   * Contacts
   * Investigations
   * Exposures
   * Relationships
   * Clinical and environmental specimens/samples
   * Laboratory results
   * Vaccinations and treatments
   * Travel history
   * Conveyance information
5. The system should allow for the creation and definition of new objects during an investigation.
6. It must facilitate the creation of traceable links between cases, exposures, and other relevant entities.
7. The system should support integration with:

   * Early event detection systems
   * Countermeasure administration systems
   * Laboratory systems
   * Surveillance systems

### **Non-Functional Requirements** (Quality constraints and performance expectations)

1. **Configurability** – The system should be adaptable to different types of health events.
2. **Scalability** – It should handle various levels of outbreak data collection and management.
3. **Interoperability** – The system must integrate with other public health systems for early event detection, countermeasure administration, laboratory processing, and surveillance.
4. **Traceability** – The system must ensure that all data relationships (cases, exposures, treatments, etc.) are properly linked and traceable.
5. **Reliability** – It should provide accurate and dependable outbreak management data.
6. **Security & Privacy** – The system must protect sensitive health information and ensure compliance with relevant regulations.
7. **Performance** – The system should efficiently process and manage large amounts of data in a timely manner.
8. **Usability** – The system should be user-friendly and support efficient data entry and retrieval for public health officials.

These requirements ensure that the **Public Health Information Network (PHIN) Outbreak Management (OM) System** is both functional and meets the necessary quality constraints.

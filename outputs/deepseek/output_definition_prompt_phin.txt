Based on the description provided, the **functional** and **non-functional** requirements for the Public Health Information Network (PHIN) system, specifically for Outbreak Management (OM), can be extracted as follows:

---

### **Functional Requirements**:
1. **Data Collection and Analysis**:
   - The system must support the collection and analysis of data to identify and contain health events or acts of bioterrorism.
   - It should capture data related to:
     - Cases
     - Contacts
     - Investigations
     - Exposures
     - Relationships
     - Clinical and environmental specimens/samples
     - Laboratory results
     - Vaccinations and treatments
     - Travel history
     - Conveyance information

2. **Configurability**:
   - The system should be configurable to meet the needs of different types of health events.

3. **Dynamic Object Creation**:
   - The application should allow for new objects to be defined and created during the course of an investigation.

4. **Traceable Links**:
   - The system must create traceable links between all appropriate entities (e.g., cases, exposures, contacts, etc.).
   - It should trace the mechanism of transmission and identify the source of the health event.

5. **Integration with Other Systems**:
   - The system should integrate with systems supporting:
     - Early event detection
     - Countermeasure administration
     - Laboratory systems
     - Surveillance systems

6. **Support for Investigation and Reporting**:
   - The system must support the investigation, monitoring, management, analysis, and reporting of health events.

---

### **Non-Functional Requirements**:
1. **Scalability**:
   - The system should handle varying volumes of data and users, depending on the scale of the health event.

2. **Reliability**:
   - The system must be reliable and available during critical health events to ensure continuous operation.

3. **Performance**:
   - The system should perform efficiently, even when processing large amounts of data or during high user demand.

4. **Security**:
   - The system must ensure the security and confidentiality of sensitive health data.

5. **Usability**:
   - The system should be user-friendly and intuitive for response staff to use effectively during emergencies.

6. **Interoperability**:
   - The system must seamlessly integrate with other systems (e.g., early event detection, laboratory, surveillance) to ensure cohesive functionality.

7. **Maintainability**:
   - The system should be easy to maintain and update to adapt to new requirements or health event scenarios.

8. **Compliance**:
   - The system must comply with relevant health data standards and regulations.

These requirements ensure that the PHIN system effectively supports outbreak management while meeting quality and operational standards.

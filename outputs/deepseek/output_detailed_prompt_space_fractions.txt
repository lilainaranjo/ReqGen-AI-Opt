### **Functional Requirements**  

#### **1. Umbrella System (Game Menu)**  
- **Centralized Menu**: Implement a web-based menu as the entry point. Users must see a grid or list of available games, each represented by a visually distinct tile (e.g., with game title, thumbnail, and brief description).  
  - *Example*: Tiles for "Space Fractions," "Fraction Galaxy," and "Decimal Quest."  
- **Game Launch**: Clicking a game tile must redirect the user to the standalone game URL.  
- **Navigation**: Include a persistent "Return to Menu" button in the header/footer of all games to navigate back to the umbrella menu.  
- **Dynamic Game Management**: Use a centralized configuration file (e.g., `games.json`) to manage game metadata. Adding/removing a game requires only updating this file.  
  ```json
  // Example games.json  
  [
    {
      "id": "space-fractions",
      "title": "Space Fractions",
      "description": "Solve fraction problems in space!",
      "thumbnailUrl": "/assets/space-fractions-thumbnail.png",
      "gameUrl": "/games/space-fractions/index.html"
    },
    // ... other games
  ]
  ```  
- **Responsive Layout**: The menu must adapt to desktop (≥1024px), tablet (768px–1023px), and mobile (<768px) screens. Tablet/mobile views show 2 tiles per row; desktop shows 4.  

#### **2. Space Fractions Game**  
- **Game Flow**:  
  1. **Start Screen**: Display game title, "Start" button, and brief instructions (e.g., "Solve 10 fraction problems to save the spaceship!").  
  2. **Problem-Solving Phase**:  
     - Present one problem at a time.  
     - Progress indicator (e.g., "Question 3/10").  
  3. **Scoring**: Award 10 points per correct answer. No penalties for wrong answers.  
  4. **End Screen**: Show final score (0–100 points) and feedback.  
- **Fraction Problems**:  
  - **Content**: Generate problems for sixth-grade standards (e.g., `2/3 + 1/4`, `3/5 × 2/7`, simplifying `12/16`).  
  - **Interaction**: Support multiple-choice (4 options) or fill-in-the-blank input.  
    - *Example*: "What is 1/2 + 1/3? [A] 2/5 [B] 5/6 [C] 1/6 [D] 3/5".  
  - **Validation**: Immediately validate answers and provide visual feedback (e.g., green check for correct, red "X" for incorrect).  
- **Feedback Mechanism**:  
  - Map scores to feedback messages:  
    - 0–40 points: "Keep practicing! Try again."  
    - 41–70 points: "Good effort! Review mixed fractions."  
    - 71–99 points: "Great job! You’re mastering fractions!"  
    - 100 points: "Perfect! You’re a fraction expert!"  
- **Exit Options**:  
  - "Back to Menu" button visible during gameplay (e.g., top-left corner).  
  - Post-game screen includes "Play Again" and "Back to Menu" buttons.  

#### **3. Cross-Game Consistency**  
- **Shared UI Elements**:  
  - All games must use the same "Return to Menu" button design (e.g., blue button with a house icon).  
  - Implement a unified color scheme (e.g., space-themed: dark background, stars).  
- **Session Handling**: Games run independently. No login or saved progress between sessions.

### **Non-Functional Requirements**  

#### **1. Usability & Accessibility**  
- **Target Audience**: Sixth-grade students (ages 11–12).  
  - Use simple language (e.g., "Solve this problem" instead of "Compute the quotient").  
  - Avoid complex interactions (e.g., no drag-and-drop for mobile).  
- **Accessibility (WCAG 2.1)**:  
  - Support screen readers (alt text for images, ARIA labels).  
  - Color contrast ratio ≥ 4.5:1 (e.g., white text on dark blue).  
  - Keyboard navigation (Tab to select answers, Enter to submit).  

#### **2. Performance**  
- **Load Time**:  
  - Umbrella menu loads in ≤2 seconds on 4G networks.  
  - Games load in ≤3 seconds.  
- **Responsiveness**:  
  - Buttons/inputs respond within 100ms.  
  - Animations run at 60fps.  

#### **3. Compatibility**  
- **Browsers**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge (latest versions).  
- **Devices**:  
  - Desktop: Mouse/keyboard support.  
  - Mobile/Tablet: Touch-friendly buttons (min 44×44px).  
- **Resolutions**: Support down to 320px width (e.g., iPhone SE).  

#### **4. Security**  
- **Sanitization**: Validate/sanitize all user inputs (e.g., for fill-in-the-blank answers) to prevent XSS attacks.  
- **HTTPS**: Serve all content over HTTPS.  

#### **5. Maintainability & Scalability**  
- **Modularity**:  
  - Umbrella and games are separate codebases.  
  - Games communicate with the umbrella via URL parameters (e.g., `?game=space-fractions`).  
- **Adding New Games**:  
  1. Add game metadata to `games.json`.  
  2. Place game files in `/games/<game-id>/`.  
  3. Thumbnails in `/assets/`.  
- **Scalability**:  
  - Static hosting (e.g., AWS S3, Netlify) suffices for ≤10,000 monthly users.  

#### **6. Reliability**  
- **Error Handling**:  
  - Game crashes → Display "Oops! Something went wrong. Return to Menu."  
  - Missing game → Umbrella menu shows "Game Unavailable."  
- **Testing**:  
  - Unit tests for scoring logic (e.g., `score=70 → "Great job!"`).  
  - Cross-browser/device testing via BrowserStack.

### **Assumptions & Examples**  
1. **Time Limits**: No time constraints for problems.  
   - *Why*: Reduces pressure on learners.  
2. **Game Duration**: Space Fractions has exactly 10 problems.  
   - *Why*: Matches sixth-grade attention spans (≤15 minutes).  
3. **Device Connections**:  
   - No external hardware (e.g., gamepads). Touch/mouse/keyboard only.  
4. **Scoring Feedback**: Feedback tiers based on predefined ranges (see above).  
5. **Data Privacy**: No user accounts → No personal data collected.  
6. **Offline Use**: Not supported. Requires internet access.

### **Implementation Deliverables**  
1. **Umbrella System**:  
   - Menu page (`index.html`) that reads `games.json` and renders tiles.  
   - CSS for responsive grids.  
2. **Space Fractions Game**:  
   - Standalone folder (`/games/space-fractions/`) with:  
     - `index.html` (game structure).  
     - `game.js` (problem generation, scoring).  
     - `styles.css` (UI).  
3. **Shared Assets**:  
   - Icons (e.g., "Return to Menu" button).  
   - Error/feedback message templates.

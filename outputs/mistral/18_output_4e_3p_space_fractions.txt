 Functional Requirements (FR):

1) FR1: The application shall provide users access through a browser interface. No installation is required; only internet connection is needed.
2) FR2: Users must have the ability to log into the platform using Google accounts. This allows teachers to monitor student progress easily while ensuring privacy protection.
3) FR3: Upon logging in, players can select from various available games within the "Space Fraction" category. These include 'Fraction Frenzy', 'Meteor Mashup' and 'Asteroid Attack'. Each game has its unique mechanics designed around solving fractions.
4) FR4: Players need to solve problems presented during each level/round of the selected game. Correct answers allow them to proceed further, whereas incorrect ones result in losing lives or points.
5) FR5: For every correct answer, players earn coins which they can use later to unlock new levels or buy powerups. Incorrect responses deduct coins instead.
6) FR6: As part of the scoring mechanism, players receive immediate feedback about whether their response was right or wrong along with explanatory messages if applicable.
7) FR7: After completing all rounds in one particular game, players get ranked according to their score compared against other participants worldwide. They can view this ranking by clicking on the leaderboard option displayed at the main screen after finishing a game session.
8) FR8: Teachers who want to track individual student performance can do so via the teacher dashboard where they find detailed reports containing data such as total attempts made, success rate, average time taken per question, etc., for each player under their supervision.
9) FR9: To ensure fairness among competitors, the system randomly assigns questions to different players even though some might appear similar due to shared denominators or numerator values. However, no two identical questions exist across multiple sessions.
10) FR10: When playing a game, users can pause it temporarily before resuming play whenever desired. Scores earned prior to pausing remain saved until the next login.
11) FR11: A tutorial mode provides guidance for first-time users unfamiliar with navigating the website or understanding how certain features work. It includes step-by-step instructions accompanied by visual demonstration videos.
12) FR12: Students can save their progress midway through a game round and continue later. Progress saving occurs automatically upon answering correctly three times consecutively or manually triggered by pressing the appropriate button provided onscreen.
13) FR13: All interactions within the app occur real-time, meaning delays caused by network latency won’t affect overall functionality.
14) FR14: The software supports multiplayer modes enabling up to four people to compete simultaneously. Participants join rooms hosted either locally or remotely depending on availability.
15) FR15: Game developers can create customized versions tailored towards specific educational needs or age groups. Such modifications involve altering difficulty settings, adding more complex math operations, adjusting graphics styles, etc. Developers submit these variations back to our team for review and possible inclusion in future updates.
16) FR16: Administrative staff members responsible for managing content uploaded onto the site require separate authentication credentials than regular users. Their account grants permission to modify existing resources like images, text descriptions, video files, audio clips, etc.
17) FR17: System administrators possess higher privileges over standard users since they manage server infrastructure, perform maintenance tasks, troubleshoot issues related to hardware components, and handle security concerns. Access restrictions apply here too – admins cannot edit sensitive data belonging exclusively to school districts or government agencies.
18) FR18: The program offers support for English language learners by translating key phrases used throughout the UI into Spanish, French, German, Italian, Dutch, Polish, Portuguese, Russian, Chinese Simplified & Traditional, Japanese, Korean, Arabic, Hebrew, Turkish, Thai, Vietnamese, Hindi, Urdu, Bengali, Gujarati, Marathi, Tamil, Telugu, Malayalam, Kannada, Punjabi, Persian, Swahili, Somali, Amharic, Yiddish, and Afrikaans languages. Translated terms display alongside original English words.
19) FR19: An optional feature called “Teacher Mode” enables educators to control aspects of the game environment directly from their computer screens. Examples include setting target scores, disabling timers, locking out certain functions, and modifying problem types shown to pupils.
20) FR20: Educational institutions interested in adopting the Space Fractions Project can request API keys granting read-only access to analytics data stored centrally. Data retrievable via APIs encompasses details regarding usage patterns, demographics, geographical distribution, engagement metrics, and more. Institutions can utilize this information to optimize teaching strategies, identify trends, and evaluate resource allocation effectiveness.

Non-Functional Requirements (NFR):

1) NFR1: The entire solution runs seamlessly inside modern browsers including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, Opera Mini, UC Browser, Dolphin, Puffin, Maxthon, QQBrowser, 360Secure, CM Browser, and AndNavigator. Compatibility extends beyond desktop platforms to mobile devices running Android OS version 4.x+ and iOS 9.x+.
2) NFR2: Minimum bandwidth requirement stands at 512 kbps download speed for optimal experience. Lower speeds could lead to slower loading times and reduced responsiveness.
3) NFR3: Web pages load quickly enough to prevent frustration amongst users waiting extended periods. Initial page loads take less than five seconds regardless of location or device type. Subsequent requests complete within milliseconds once initial assets have been cached.
4) NFR4: Screen resolution compatibility spans across popular smartphones, tablets, laptops, desktops, and TV sets ranging from 320 x 240 pixels to 4K Ultra HD displays supporting aspect ratios of 4:3, 16:9, and 16:10. Responsive design ensures consistent layout presentation independent of viewing context.
5) NFR5: User interfaces render smoothly thanks to efficient JavaScript code execution minimizing CPU utilization rates below 5%. Highly demanding animations consume slightly greater processing overhead peaking near 10% maximum.
6) NFR6: Application logic relies heavily on HTML5 technologies such as Canvas, Audio, Video, Geolocation, Local Storage, IndexedDB, Service Workers, and WebRTC. Cross-browser consistency remains paramount despite differences in implementation across vendors.
7) NFR7: Codebase structure follows best practices outlined in ECMAScript standards, specifically ES6 modules. Modularity promotes maintainability, scalability, and reusability whilst reducing complexity associated with large projects.
8) NFR8: Source code conforms to strict linting rules set forth by ESLint configuration profiles. Automatic fix suggestions minimize manual intervention improving developer productivity.
9) NFR9: Test coverage exceeds industry benchmarks reaching approximately 90%, thereby mitigating risks stemming from unforeseen defects impacting production deployments. Unit tests employ Jest framework, while integration testing leverages Cypress tools. Both solutions facilitate rapid development cycles promoting continuous delivery methodologies.
10) NFR10: Security measures implemented throughout the stack protect customer data integrity and confidentiality. Encryption algorithms secure communication channels preventing eavesdropping attacks. Authentication mechanisms verify identity claims submitted by clients seeking authorization to interact with backend services. Input validation techniques guard against malicious input injection vulnerabilities. Regular audits assess compliance with OWASP Top Ten guidelines addressing common threats affecting web applications today.

**Assumptions:**

1. **User Roles:**
   - We assume that there will be two user roles: students and administrators.
   - Students will have access to the game selection menu and will be able to play games.
   - Administrators will have access to the game selection menu and will also have additional features to manage games, users, and analytics.

2. **Game Categories:**
   - We assume that games will be categorized by subject (e.g., math, science, etc.) and by difficulty level (e.g., easy, medium, hard).
   - We assume that games will have a unique title and a brief description.

3. **User Data:**
   - We assume that users will have a unique username and password.
   - We assume that users will have a profile that includes their name, email address, and other demographic information.

4. **Game Progress:**
   - We assume that game progress will be saved for each user, including their score, completion time, and most difficult levels.
   - We assume that game progress will be stored in a database and will be accessible to users through their account.

5. **Analytics:**
   - We assume that the system will collect analytics data on user behavior, including game completion rates, average scores, and most difficult levels.
   - We assume that analytics data will be stored in a database and will be accessible to administrators through a dashboard.

**Example Use Cases:**

1. **Student Plays Game:**
   - A student logs in to their account and selects the Space Fractions game.
   - The student completes the game and receives feedback on their answers.
   - The student's score and completion time are saved to their account.

2. **Administrator Manages Games:**
   - An administrator logs in to their account and selects the game selection menu.
   - The administrator creates a new game and sets its title, description, and difficulty level.
   - The administrator saves the game and it becomes available to students.

3. **User Reviews Game:**
   - A student logs in to their account and selects the Space Fractions game.
   - The student completes the game and reviews their answers and explanations.
   - The student provides feedback on the game and suggests improvements.

**Database Schema:**

The database schema will consist of the following tables:

1. **users:**
   - id (primary key)
   - username
   - password
   - name
   - email
   - demographic information

2. **games:**
   - id (primary key)
   - title
   - description
   - difficulty level
   - category

3. **game_progress:**
   - id (primary key)
   - user_id (foreign key referencing users)
   - game_id (foreign key referencing games)
   - score
   - completion time
   - most difficult levels

4. **analytics:**
   - id (primary key)
   - user_id (foreign key referencing users)
   - game_id (foreign key referencing games)
   - completion rate
   - average score
   - most difficult levels

Note: This is a simplified database schema and may need to be modified based on the specific requirements of the system.

 Functional Requirements (FR):\\
1. FR1: The application shall display a main screen where users can select one of two available games – "Space Invaders" or "Pong". Users can switch between these games at any point during play. \\
2. FR2: When selecting either game, the application shall present a brief tutorial explaining how to play it. This tutorial shall appear only once per session. \\
3. FR3: The Space Invaders game shall consist of three levels. In each level, the player controls a spaceship moving horizontally across the bottom of the screen while shooting upwards. The invading aliens move downward from the top of the screen towards the player's ship. Each alien represents a certain number of fractions. Shooting an alien destroys it, awarding points equal to its value. If an alien reaches the player's ship, they lose a life. Losing all lives ends the game. \\
4. FR4: After completing a level, the player receives feedback about their performance in terms of accuracy and speed. They then proceed to the next level. \\
5. FR5: The Pong game shall have four levels. Players control a paddle moving vertically along the left side of the screen, reflecting incoming balls back to the opponent's paddle. Each ball hit by both players awards points. Missed balls result in losing a point. If the opponent loses all points first, the player wins and moves onto the next level. \\
6. FR6: After completing a level, the player receives feedback about their performance in terms of accuracy and speed. They then proceed to the next level. \\

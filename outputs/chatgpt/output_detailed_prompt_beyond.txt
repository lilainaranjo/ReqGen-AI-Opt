# System Requirements Specification for BEYOND Macro-Project

## **1. Functional Requirements**

### **1.1. Authoring Tool for UI Development (Philips DVS Project)**

#### **1.1.1. UI Modification Capabilities**

* The tool **must** allow UI designers to modify the behavior of user interfaces without requiring extensive reprogramming.
* Changes should be applied in real-time or with minimal compilation effort.
* Example: A designer should be able to adjust a menuâ€™s navigation logic or button behavior via a graphical interface.

#### **1.1.2. Support for Adaptive User Interfaces**

* The tool **must** allow the creation of user interfaces that adapt dynamically to:

  * Screen sizes and resolutions (e.g., from small handheld devices to large TV displays).
  * User preferences (e.g., high-contrast mode for accessibility).
  * Context of use (e.g., different interaction models based on whether the device is in a stationary or mobile environment).
* Adaptive elements should be customizable without modifying core UI logic.

#### **1.1.3. Functional Specification for Next-Generation Consumer Products**

* The tool **must** include a structured method for defining functional requirements.
* A requirements editor should allow designers to specify:

  * UI states and transitions.
  * Input and output behaviors for different interaction modes (touch, remote control, voice commands).
  * Constraints imposed by consumer electronics, such as limited processing power or memory.

### **1.2. Intelligent Software Layer with a User-Definable UI**

#### **1.2.1. User-Definable UI**

* The firmware must provide a UI **Interpreter** that can:

  * Read and execute UI descriptions from external files.
  * Support multiple UI layouts without requiring firmware changes.
* Example: Users should be able to define a new UI theme and load it into a smart TV without reflashing the device.

#### **1.2.2. UI Interpreter for Generated Code**

* The UI interpreter **must**:

  * Process UI code generated by the UI Editor.
  * Render UI elements dynamically based on the interpreted structure.
* The system **must** support multiple rendering modes (e.g., vector-based, bitmap-based).

#### **1.2.3. Simulation Module**

* A **simulation module** **must** be incorporated into the UI Editor.
* The module should allow developers to:

  * Preview and interact with the UI on a **development computer** before deployment.
  * Simulate user input (e.g., mouse clicks, touch gestures, keyboard commands).
* The simulation should be as accurate as possible to the target system (e.g., supporting device-specific constraints like screen refresh rates).

## **2. Non-Functional Requirements**

### **2.1. Performance**

* The authoring tool and simulation module **must** run efficiently on modern development machines (minimum hardware: quad-core CPU, 16GB RAM).
* The UI interpreter **must** execute UI code with a **response time** of no more than 50ms for any interaction.

### **2.2. Scalability**

* The authoring tool **must** support UI projects of different complexities, from simple remote controls to advanced smart home interfaces.
* The UI interpreter **must** support **at least 10 concurrent UI elements** on screen at any time.

### **2.3. Usability**

* The authoring tool **must** provide an intuitive GUI with **drag-and-drop** functionality for UI design.
* The tool **must** support undo/redo actions for design modifications.
* The UI Editor **must** include built-in tutorials and tooltips.

### **2.4. Compatibility**

* The UI interpreter **must** be deployable on embedded consumer devices such as:

  * Smart TVs
  * Home automation controllers
  * Wearable devices
* The UI Editor **must** run on Windows, macOS, and Linux.

### **2.5. Maintainability**

* The system **must** allow modular updates, where:

  * UI Editor features can be expanded without breaking existing projects.
  * The UI interpreter can support new UI elements without requiring major firmware modifications.

### **2.6. Security**

* The authoring tool **must** prevent unauthorized modifications to UI designs (e.g., password protection for project files).
* The UI interpreter **must** validate UI code before execution to avoid crashes or security vulnerabilities.

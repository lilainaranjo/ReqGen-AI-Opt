**Example Code:**

**Front-end (React):**
```jsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from'react';
import axios from 'axios';

function App() {
  const [games, setGames] = useState([]);
  const [selectedGame, setSelectedGame] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    axios.get('/api/games')
     .then(response => {
        setGames(response.data);
      })
     .catch(error => {
        console.error(error);
      });
  }, []);

  const handleGameSelect = (game) => {
    setSelectedGame(game);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Space Fractions</h1>
      <ul>
        {games.map((game) => (
          <li key={game.id}>
            <button onClick={() => handleGameSelect(game)}>{game.name}</button>
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
      {selectedGame && (
        <div>
          <h2>{selectedGame.name}</h2>
          <p>{selectedGame.description}</p>
          <button onClick={() => handleGameSelect(null)}>Back</button>
        </div>
      )}
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

**Back-end (Node.js):**
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const mysql = require('mysql');

const db = mysql.createConnection({
  host: 'localhost',
  user: 'username',
  password: 'password',
  database: 'database'
});

app.get('/api/games', (req, res) => {
  db.query('SELECT * FROM games', (error, results) => {
    if (error) {
      console.error(error);
      res.status(500).send({ message: 'Error fetching games' });
    } else {
      res.send(results);
    }
  });
});

app.get('/api/game/:id', (req, res) => {
  const id = req.params.id;
  db.query(`SELECT * FROM games WHERE id = ${id}`, (error, results) => {
    if (error) {
      console.error(error);
      res.status(500).send({ message: 'Error fetching game' });
    } else {
      res.send(results[0]);
    }
  });
});

app.post('/api/game/:id/submit', (req, res) => {
  const id = req.params.id;
  const score = req.body.score;
  db.query(`UPDATE games SET score = ${score} WHERE id = ${id}`, (error, results) => {
    if (error) {
      console.error(error);
      res.status(500).send({ message: 'Error submitting game' });
    } else {
      res.send({ message: 'Game submitted successfully' });
    }
  });
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server listening on port 3000');
});
```

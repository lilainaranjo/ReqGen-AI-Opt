 Functional Requirements (FR):
1) FR1: When users first access the application they shall have two options available - "Play Game" & "Umbrella". Users must select either option before proceeding further into the program. [Web Application]
2) FR2: Upon selecting 'Play Game', players can start playing immediately by clicking anywhere within the play area; no additional steps required prior to starting the actual gameplay session. Players cannot pause during this phase until reaching 50% completion mark. Once at least half way through the level has been reached then pauses become possible if desired/needed. Pauses do NOT save progress automatically so player MUST click resume button after resuming from paused state otherwise all work completed up till point where last saved checkpoint was encountered WILL BE LOST! Player CANNOT return back once leaving current screen unless returning via browser's Back Button which results in loss of unsaved data since it does not reload page content upon navigating away using said methodology. After completing each round successfully, student receives immediate positive reinforcement message along with score displayed prominently across top bar followed closely behind by negative reinforced statement indicating missed opportunities accompanied by corresponding percentage value below main header text element(either above or beneath depending on layout design). Student moves onto next stage only AFTER pressing continue key located directly underneath final result display panel OR waiting five seconds while timer counts down visually represented inside small circular icon placed adjacent to countdown number sequence. This delay allows sufficient processing power needed to calculate new difficulty setting parameters ensuring smooth transition throughout entire experience regardless of hardware limitations present due to outdated devices being utilized among target demographic groupings.[Browser Based Web App / Mobile Device Compatible Browser Applications Only.]
3) FR4: Students who complete levels quickly receive higher rewards than those taking longer periods of time to finish tasks assigned them thus encouraging faster problem solving techniques over slower ones resulting ultimately leading towards more efficient use of resources both mental AND physical thereby enhancing overall cognitive abilities associated specifically WITH FRACTION SOLVING SKILLS WHICH ARE THE PRIMARY GOAL OF THIS PROJECT AS A LEARNING TOOL FOR STUDENTS IN GRADE LEVEL EIGHT THROUGHOUT UNITED STATES AMERICA[USA].

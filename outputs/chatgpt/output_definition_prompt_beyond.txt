Here are the extracted functional and non-functional requirements:

### **Functional Requirements:**

1. The authoring tool should allow easy modification of the behavior of user interfaces.
2. The authoring tool should support easy development of adaptive user interfaces.
3. The authoring tool should allow the functional requirements specification of the next generation of consumer products to be developed in a much faster and efficient manner.
4. The system should provide an intelligent software layer where the User Interface is User Definable.
5. The firmware should support adding a "UI interpreter" to interpret and visualize the UI code generated by the UI Editor.
6. The UI-Editor must have a simulation module to test the complete system offline on a development computer before loading the generated code into the Vector System.

### **Non-Functional Requirements:**

1. The authoring tool should take into account the constraints of the consumer world.
2. The development of user interfaces should be efficient and fast.
3. The system should ensure adaptability in user interface design.
4. The UI-Editor should have a seamless and reliable simulation module for offline testing.
5. The system should maintain modularity and extensibility to accommodate future UI requirements.

Would you like me to refine or categorize these further based on priority?

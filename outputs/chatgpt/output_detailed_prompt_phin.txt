Here is a detailed breakdown of all necessary functional and non-functional requirements for implementing a system that supports the Public Health Information Network (PHIN) Outbreak Management (OM) functionality. This ensures there are no ambiguities or vagueness in the system's implementation.

* Contact details (address, phone, email).
* Case status (suspected, confirmed, recovered, deceased).
* Date and method of diagnosis.
* Clinical symptoms and severity.

1.1.2 The system must support capturing contact tracing data, including:

* Relationship between a case and contacts.
* Dates and types of interactions.
* Risk assessment based on proximity, duration, and exposure type.

### **1.2 Investigation and Exposure Tracking**

1.2.1 The system must allow users to initiate and manage investigations for an outbreak.
1.2.2 The system must support recording:

* Exposure types (airborne, waterborne, foodborne, zoonotic, etc.).
* Locations and times of potential exposure.
* Suspected sources and transmission pathways.

1.2.3 The system must support linking cases and contacts to exposure events with traceability.

### **1.3 Laboratory and Specimen Management**

1.3.1 The system must record details of clinical and environmental specimens/samples, including:

* Sample type (blood, saliva, water, food, etc.).
* Collection date, location, and personnel.
* Chain of custody and storage conditions.

1.3.2 The system must support integration with laboratory information systems (LIS) for:

* Submission of test orders.
* Receipt and storage of laboratory results.
* Automated alerts for positive results.
* Longitudinal tracking of a patientâ€™s test history.

### **1.4 Vaccinations and Treatments**

1.4.1 The system must support recording:

* Vaccination status (vaccine type, dose number, administration date).
* Treatment details (medications, dosages, administration dates).
* Adverse reactions.

1.4.2 The system must allow configurable vaccination schedules based on outbreak characteristics.

### **1.5 Travel and Conveyance Information**

1.5.1 The system must collect travel history, including:

* Dates and locations of travel.
* Means of transport (air, sea, rail, road).
* Associated transport records (flight numbers, ship manifests).

1.5.2 The system must support integration with transportation data sources.

### **1.6 Dynamic Data Model & Configurability**

1.6.1 The system must allow administrators to define and create new data objects dynamically.
1.6.2 These new data objects should be linked with existing objects where applicable.
1.6.3 The system must allow configuring event types, data fields, and workflows.

### **1.7 Integration with Other Public Health Systems**

1.7.1 The system must integrate with:

* **Early event detection systems** to receive alerts for potential outbreaks.
* **Countermeasure administration systems** for tracking interventions.
* **Surveillance systems** to monitor trends and patterns.
* **Electronic Health Records (EHRs)** for patient data retrieval.
* **Geographic Information Systems (GIS)** for mapping outbreaks.

1.7.2 The system must comply with HL7 standards for interoperability.

### **1.8 Reporting and Analytics**

1.8.1 The system must generate reports on:

* Case trends and statistics.
* Exposure and transmission chain analysis.
* Laboratory results distribution.
* Vaccination and treatment effectiveness.

1.8.2 The system must provide data visualization tools such as:

* Heatmaps of outbreak spread.
* Contact network diagrams.
* Timeline progression charts.

### **1.9 User Roles and Access Control**

1.9.1 The system must support multiple user roles with granular permissions:

* Investigators: Full access to case and exposure data.
* Laboratory personnel: Access to specimen tracking and test results.
* Public health officials: Access to aggregate reports.
* Administrators: Configuration and system management.

1.9.2 The system must enforce access control through role-based authentication.

### **1.10 Audit Trails and Data Security**

1.10.1 The system must maintain a complete audit log of:

* Data entry, modifications, and deletions.
* User access and activity.
* System configuration changes.

1.10.2 The system must comply with HIPAA, CDC, and other relevant public health data security regulations.

## **2. Non-Functional Requirements**

These define system quality attributes and constraints.

### **2.1 Performance**

2.1.1 The system must support at least 10,000 concurrent users with minimal latency.
2.1.2 Data retrieval times should not exceed 2 seconds for standard queries.

### **2.2 Scalability**

2.2.1 The system must scale horizontally to support increased workload during large outbreaks.
2.2.2 It should support multi-region deployments for nationwide use.

### **2.3 Availability & Reliability**

2.3.1 The system must maintain **99.9% uptime**.
2.3.2 It must support **automatic failover** and disaster recovery.

### **2.4 Data Consistency & Integrity**

2.4.1 The system must prevent duplicate records through validation mechanisms.
2.4.2 Data integrity must be ensured via transactional consistency in case investigations.

### **2.5 Usability**

2.5.1 The system must have an intuitive UI with:

* Interactive dashboards.
* Simple workflows for data entry and linking.
* Mobile-friendly interface.

### **2.6 Compliance & Legal**

2.6.1 The system must comply with:

* **HIPAA** for patient privacy.
* **FERPA** if educational institutions are involved.
* **CDC reporting standards**.

## **3. Assumptions and Clarifications**

To remove ambiguity, the following assumptions have been made:

1. **Time References:** Any reference to "tracking cases over time" assumes daily updates with timestamps.
2. **Integration Mechanisms:** Data exchange with external systems will be via secure RESTful APIs using JSON.
3. **New Object Creation:** Users will be able to define new outbreak-specific objects (e.g., "Mutation Type") with a simple UI.
4. **Access Revocation:** If an outbreak is contained, system admins can archive cases while retaining audit logs.
5. **Incident Duration Tracking:** Each health event will have a start and end date, with extension options.

## **4. Example Use Case: COVID-19 Outbreak**

A health department using this system for COVID-19 would:

* Register an index case with full demographics and symptom onset.
* Trace contacts by linking household members and workplaces.
* Record positive lab results from integrated testing facilities.
* Track vaccine administration status for each case.
* Generate reports showing transmission hotspots.

### **Final Thoughts**

This document provides an unambiguous, detailed foundation for implementing a PHIN OM system. Every functional component is defined with clear expectations and examples. If further details are needed, an iterative refinement process should be conducted with public health stakeholders.

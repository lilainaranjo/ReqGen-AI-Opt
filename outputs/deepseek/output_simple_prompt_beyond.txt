### Functional Requirements:

1. **Philips DVS Authoring Tool:**
   - The tool should allow **easy modification of the behavior of user interfaces**.
   - The tool should support the **development of adaptive user interfaces**.
   - The tool should enable **functional requirements specification** for the next generation of consumer products in a **faster and more efficient manner**.
   - The tool should support **visualization, specification, design, and code generation** of user interfaces, particularly for **screen-based user interfaces and control**.
   - The tool should consider the **constraints of the consumer world** (e.g., performance, usability, and resource limitations).

2. **Intelligent Software Layer (UI-Editor):**
   - The software layer should have a **user-definable user interface**.
   - The firmware structure should support the addition of a **UI interpreter** to interpret and visualize the UI code generated by the UI Editor.
   - The UI-Editor must include a **simulation module** to test the complete system **off-line** on a development computer before deploying the generated code to the Vector System.

### Non-Functional Requirements:

1. **Philips DVS Authoring Tool:**
   - **Usability**: The tool should be intuitive and easy to use for designers and developers.
   - **Efficiency**: The tool should enable faster development cycles for consumer products.
   - **Adaptability**: The tool should support the creation of adaptive user interfaces that can adjust to different user needs or environments.
   - **Compatibility**: The tool should work seamlessly with consumer product constraints (e.g., limited processing power, memory, etc.).

2. **Intelligent Software Layer (UI-Editor):**
   - **Flexibility**: The software layer should allow users to define and customize the user interface according to their preferences.
   - **Simulation Accuracy**: The simulation module should accurately replicate the behavior of the system in the Vector System.
   - **Integration**: The firmware structure should be designed to easily integrate the UI interpreter and other components.
   - **Off-line Testing**: The simulation module should allow for thorough testing without the need for physical hardware.

### Summary:
- **Functional Requirements** focus on what the system should do (e.g., modify behavior, support adaptive UIs, generate code, simulate systems).
- **Non-Functional Requirements** focus on how the system should perform (e.g., usability, efficiency, flexibility, accuracy).

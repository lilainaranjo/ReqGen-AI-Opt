Based on the provided description, we can extract the **functional requirements (FR)** and **non-functional requirements (NFR)** for the BEYOND macro-project as follows:

---

### **1. Philips DVS Project**
#### **Functional Requirements (FR):**
- The authoring tool should allow easy modification of the behavior of user interfaces.
- The authoring tool should support easy development of adaptive user interfaces.
- The authoring tool should allow the functional requirements specification of the next generation of consumer products to be developed in a much faster and efficient manner.

#### **Non-Functional Requirements (NFR):**
- The authoring tool must take into account the constraints of the consumer world (e.g., performance, usability, and resource limitations).
- The tool should emphasize screen-based user interfaces and control, ensuring compatibility with consumer product standards.

---

### **2. Intelligent Software Layer Project**
#### **Functional Requirements (FR):**
- The software layer must have a user-definable User Interface (UI).
- The firmware structure should support the addition of a ‘UI interpreter’ to interpret and visualize the UI code generated by the UI Editor.
- The UI Editor must include a simulation module to test the complete system off-line on a development computer before loading the generated code into the Vector System.

#### **Non-Functional Requirements (NFR):**
- The software layer should be designed to ensure flexibility and adaptability for user-defined UIs.
- The simulation module must provide accurate and reliable off-line testing capabilities to ensure the generated code works as intended before deployment.

---

### Summary:
- **Functional Requirements** focus on what the system should do (e.g., modifying UI behavior, supporting adaptive UIs, enabling user-definable UIs, and providing simulation capabilities).
- **Non-Functional Requirements** focus on how the system should perform (e.g., adhering to consumer world constraints, ensuring compatibility, and providing reliable simulation).

 Functional Requirements (FR):

1) FR1: The application shall provide users access through a browser interface via HTTPS protocol. No installation required; no need to download anything before using it. Users can play from anywhere they have internet connection.
2) FR2: Upon entering the website's URL into a supported web browser, the homepage must display immediately after loading completely within 5 seconds. It includes links to all available mini-games under one main title "Space Fraction". A brief introduction about each game along with its difficulty level should appear below the respective link.
3) FR3: When clicking on a particular game, players get redirected directly onto the selected page where instructions regarding how to start playing are displayed clearly at first glance. Players then click 'Start Game', which takes them straight away to the actual gaming environment. They cannot return back once started unless closing down the entire tab/browser window.
4) FR4: Each game consists of multiple levels designed progressively harder than previous ones. As soon as reaching the last stage successfully, participants receive immediate positive reinforcement by being shown final results including total score achieved during this session compared against other peers who played previously. This encourages repeat visits since everyone wants better grades!
5) FR5: For every correct answer provided while solving problems presented throughout the gameplay process, points accumulate accordingly until completing either current task(level), moving forward towards next stages if applicable, or finishing overall challenge altogether depending upon chosen activity type. Incorrect responses result in point deduction instead.
6) FR6: After answering questions correctly several times consecutively, bonus multipliers increase exponentially up to x8 maximum value per question answered accurately. Conversely, incorrect answers reset these bonuses to default values starting over again. Bonus rewards apply only toward scoring calculations used later for comparison purposes among fellow gamers worldwide.
7) FR7: Once finished participating in a single game, individuals automatically move ahead to another selection screen showcasing various options such as revisiting recently completed activities, trying out new challenges, viewing personal statistics across different sessions, comparing performance versus others online, requesting hints whenever stuck, reading helpful tips & tricks related specifically to fractions, exploring additional resources like videos explaining complex concepts more thoroughly, contacting support staff members for assistance, logging off permanently, or simply exiting entirely.
8) FR8: All data collected pertaining to individual player profiles remain private except those shared voluntarily with friends or family members. However, administrators reserve rights to review records containing sensitive details concerning fraudulent behavior patterns potentially impacting fairness standards maintained throughout our platform. Any detected irregularity could lead to account suspension temporarily pending further investigation.
9) FR9: To ensure optimal functionality regardless of hardware configuration, developers test applications rigorously prior to deployment ensuring compatibility issues do not occur due to differences in operating systems, browsers, devices, network configurations, software versions, plugins installed locally, security settings applied globally, or even varying input methods employed by distinct users interacting concurrently.
10) FR10: System designers implement responsive design techniques enabling seamless navigation across desktop computers, laptops, tablets, smartphones, phablet screens, televisions, digital signage displays, virtual reality headsets, augmented reality glasses, wearables, IoT appliances, and future technologies yet unimagined today.
11) FR11: Developers use modern programming languages compatible cross-platform environments supporting both frontend and backend development tasks simultaneously.

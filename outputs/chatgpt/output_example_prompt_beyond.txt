Here is a refined extraction of functional and non-functional requirements, ensuring clarity and specificity:

---

### **Functional Requirements**

1. **BEY-1**: The authoring tool shall provide an interface to modify the behavior of user interfaces without requiring code changes.
2. **BEY-2**: The authoring tool shall include features for designing and implementing adaptive user interfaces that respond dynamically to user interactions and system conditions.
3. **BEY-3**: The authoring tool shall enable the specification of functional requirements for consumer product user interfaces, reducing development time compared to traditional methods.
4. **BEY-4**: The system shall incorporate a software layer that allows users to define and modify user interfaces at runtime.
5. **BEY-5**: The firmware shall include a UI interpreter that processes and renders UI code generated by the UI Editor in real time.
6. **BEY-6**: The UI Editor shall include a simulation module that allows developers to test the complete system on a development computer before deploying the UI code to the Vector System.

### **Non-Functional Requirements**

1. **BEY-NF1**: The authoring tool shall provide an interface that allows users to specify functional requirements with minimal input complexity, ensuring efficiency in UI design.
2. **BEY-NF2**: The system shall operate within the hardware and software constraints typically found in consumer electronic products.
3. **BEY-NF3**: The software layer architecture shall be modular, allowing seamless integration of new UI components and interpreters without modifying the core system.
4. **BEY-NF4**: The UI Editor and UI Interpreter shall maintain compatibility to ensure that user interfaces created in the editor are accurately visualized and executed by the interpreter.
5. **BEY-NF5**: The simulation module shall replicate the behavior and performance of the target hardware environment with a deviation of no more than 5% in execution time and resource usage.

This version eliminates ambiguities and ensures each requirement is specific and measurable. Let me know if you need further refinements! ðŸš€

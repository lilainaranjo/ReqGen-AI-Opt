### **BEYOND Macro-Project: Functional and Non-Functional Requirements**  
*For Philips DVS Authoring Tool and UI-Interpreter/Simulation System*  

---

### **1. Functional Requirements**  

#### **Philips DVS Authoring Tool**  
**1.1 Core UI Behavior Modification**  
- **FR1.1.1:** Provide a **visual drag-and-drop interface** for designing UI components (e.g., buttons, sliders, menus). Users must be able to modify component properties (e.g., size, color, event triggers) via a properties panel.  
- **FR1.1.2:** Enable **real-time behavior preview** during editing (e.g., clicking a button triggers an animation).  
- **FR1.1.3:** Support **version control** for UI behavior changes, allowing rollback to previous states (e.g., via a history panel).  

**1.2 Adaptive UI Development**  
- **FR1.2.1:** Allow users to define **adaptation rules** based on:  
  - **Device context** (e.g., screen resolution, orientation).  
  - **User preferences** (e.g., accessibility settings like font size).  
  - **Environmental factors** (e.g., low-light mode activation at night).  
- **FR1.2.2:** Integrate **machine learning** to suggest adaptive behaviors (e.g., recommending high-contrast themes for users with vision impairments).  
- **FR1.2.3:** Provide templates for common adaptive scenarios (e.g., mobile-to-desktop layout transitions).  

**1.3 Rapid Functional Requirements Specification**  
- **FR1.3.1:** Generate **skeleton code** in target languages (e.g., C++, JavaScript) from UI designs.  
- **FR1.3.2:** Include **pre-built UI libraries** for consumer products (e.g., TV menus, thermostat controls).  
- **FR1.3.3:** Automate **documentation generation** (e.g., PDF/HTML specs detailing UI logic and event flows).

#### **UI-Interpreter and Simulation System**  
**2.1 User-Definable UI Layer**  
- **FR2.1.1:** Implement a **UI markup language** (e.g., XML/JSON-based) to define UI structure, behavior, and adaptation rules.  
  - *Example:*  
    ```xml
    <Button id="power" onClick="togglePower()" adaptive="screen<480px:hidden"/>  
    ```  
- **FR2.1.2:** Develop a **UI interpreter** to parse and render the markup language on the target device (e.g., Vector System).  

**2.2 Simulation Module**  
- **FR2.2.1:** Emulate the **Vector System’s hardware/software environment** on a development machine (e.g., CPU, memory, screen resolution).  
- **FR2.2.2:** Allow **offline testing** of UI interactions (e.g., touch gestures, button clicks) with debug logs.  
- **FR2.2.3:** Simulate **adaptive scenarios** (e.g., low battery, network loss) to test UI responses.

### **2. Non-Functional Requirements**  

#### **Performance**  
- **NFR1:** Code generation must complete within **≤2 seconds** for UIs with ≤50 components.  
- **NFR2:** The UI interpreter must render changes in **≤100ms** to ensure real-time responsiveness.  

#### **Compatibility**  
- **NFR3:** Support **Android, iOS, and embedded Linux** (e.g., Raspberry Pi) for code generation.  
- **NFR4:** Ensure the UI interpreter runs on the **Vector System’s firmware** (assumed: ARM Cortex-M7 processor, 128MB RAM).  

#### **Usability**  
- **NFR5:** Achieve a **≤15-minute onboarding time** for users with basic UI design experience (e.g., via guided tutorials).  
- **NFR6:** Maintain a **consistent UI terminology** across tools (e.g., "Adaptive Rule" vs. "Conditional Behavior").  

#### **Scalability**  
- **NFR7:** Support UIs with **up to 200 components** without performance degradation.  

#### **Security**  
- **NFR8:** Encrypt UI markup files to prevent unauthorized tampering (e.g., AES-256).  

#### **Reliability**  
- **NFR9:** Ensure **99.9% uptime** for the simulation module during development sessions.  
- **NFR10:** Implement **automated regression testing** for generated code (e.g., unit tests for button click handlers).

### **3. Assumptions and Examples**  
- **Assumption 1:** The **Vector System** is a low-power embedded device with a 480x320 touchscreen. The simulator must replicate its 1GHz CPU and 64MB RAM constraints.  
- **Assumption 2:** Adaptive UIs prioritize **performance over aesthetics** in resource-constrained environments (e.g., disabling animations on low battery).  
- **Example for Ambiguity Resolution:**  
  - If a UI adaptation rule specifies "night mode," assume it activates when ambient light is **<50 lux** (measured via device sensors).  

---

### **4. Open Issues**  
- How will the UI interpreter handle **unsupported markup tags** (e.g., graceful degradation vs. fatal errors)?  
- What is the **maximum file size** for UI markup files (to prevent memory overflows on the Vector System)?  

--- 

This specification eliminates ambiguity by defining concrete metrics (e.g., 100ms latency), providing examples for adaptive rules, and clarifying assumptions about the target hardware. Implementers should validate these requirements against the Vector System’s technical documentation.

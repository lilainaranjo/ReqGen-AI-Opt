To ensure the development and implementation of the computerized game based on the given system description, we will break down the requirements into **functional** and **non-functional** categories. Each requirement will be detailed with specific assumptions to avoid any ambiguity or vagueness.

### **Functional Requirements:**

1. **User Interface (UI):**

   * The game must provide a graphical user interface (GUI) that includes:

     * **Menus**: Navigation menus for starting the game, adjusting settings, and exiting the game.
     * **Graphics**: Visual elements such as backgrounds, characters, and other interactive objects required for gameplay.
     * **Sounds**: Background music, sound effects, and potentially voice prompts that enhance the gameplay experience.
   * The UI must be designed in a way that is simple enough for a beginner player (starting from age 8) to navigate but also engaging for more advanced users.
   * The interface should be accessible for both mouse and keyboard input, and both should be fully functional to navigate menus and play the game.

2. **Gameplay Mechanics:**

   * The game must be designed to address a "specific headache"—likely referring to a puzzle or a problem-solving task. The exact nature of this task should be determined but can be assumed to involve a cognitive challenge, such as matching items, solving math puzzles, or completing logic problems.
   * **Levels or difficulty progression**: The game should feature a progression from beginner to advanced levels, with difficulty increasing as the player advances through the game.

     * At the beginner level (age 8 and up), the game should present simpler challenges.
     * At the advanced level (adults), the game should offer more complex and thought-provoking puzzles.

3. **Keyboard and Mouse Interaction:**

   * The game requires both a keyboard and a mouse for input. Here’s how they should be used:

     * **Keyboard**: For menu navigation (e.g., arrow keys or spacebar to select) and for in-game actions (e.g., typing commands, moving characters, or interacting with objects).
     * **Mouse**: For selecting options in the menu, clicking on in-game objects, and interacting with the game environment.
   * The user should be able to play the entire game using either the mouse or the keyboard, but not necessarily both simultaneously.

4. **Display Requirements:**

   * The game must be able to run on a display with a minimum resolution of **800x600 pixels**.
   * The game’s graphics should scale appropriately to smaller screens (if the display is smaller than 800x600) or larger screens (for displays with higher resolutions).

5. **Game Duration and Progression:**

   * Each game session should be designed to take a reasonable amount of time for users to engage with (for example, 5-20 minutes per session).
   * There should be a clear system for saving progress, such as:

     * **Manual Save**: Players can choose to save the game at any time.
     * **Auto Save**: Progress is saved at certain checkpoints or at the end of each level or stage.

6. **Player Feedback and Rewards:**

   * The game should provide immediate feedback for correct or incorrect actions (e.g., visual or auditory feedback like a "ding" sound for success, or a "buzz" for failure).
   * A scoring or reward system should be in place to track performance, such as points, medals, or level progression.
   * Players should be able to review their performance after completing each level (e.g., with a score summary or performance chart).

7. **Accessibility and Usability:**

   * The game should be easy to understand for beginners, with clear instructions provided through tooltips, tutorial modes, or an initial walkthrough.
   * Visual elements should be designed with high contrast to be accessible to players with visual impairments, and the game should support colorblind-friendly palettes if applicable.

### **Non-Functional Requirements:**

1. **Performance:**

   * The game must load within **10 seconds** on a system that meets the minimum hardware requirements (e.g., an average modern computer).
   * The game should run smoothly without lag or stuttering, even when handling complex graphics or game logic, assuming a standard configuration (800x600 resolution display).

2. **Compatibility:**

   * The game should run as a standalone application and be compatible with the most common operating systems (e.g., Windows, macOS, and Linux).
   * The system should not rely on external dependencies or plugins that may require additional installation.

3. **Hardware Requirements:**

   * **Display**: The game must work on displays with a resolution of **at least 800x600 pixels**. However, higher resolutions (e.g., 1920x1080) should be supported for a better visual experience.
   * **Input Devices**: The game requires a mouse and keyboard to interact. The mouse must have at least **two buttons** (left and right) and a scroll wheel. A standard computer keyboard should be used, supporting both alpha-numeric and function keys.
   * **Processor**: The game should be optimized to run on computers with at least a **dual-core processor** (or equivalent) to ensure smooth gameplay.
   * **Memory**: The game should operate with a minimum of **2GB of RAM**.

4. **Usability:**

   * The game should be intuitive for a wide age range of users (from age 8 to adults), with options for adjusting difficulty levels based on the player’s progress.
   * Users should be able to easily start, pause, and exit the game. The pause functionality should freeze all game elements to allow the user to take breaks without affecting game progress.

5. **Security and Data Integrity:**

   * If the game collects any user data (such as scores or preferences), this data must be securely stored. In the case of online play or data storage, the game should use encrypted connections to protect player information.
   * Local game data should be backed up or saved automatically to avoid any data loss in case of a crash or system shutdown.

6. **Sound:**

   * The sound effects and background music should be well-balanced and adjustable within the settings. Players should be able to mute sound or adjust volume independently for music, sound effects, or both.
   * Audio feedback should be provided for key actions in the game, such as successful completion of tasks, errors, or advancing to the next level.

7. **Scalability:**

   * The game should be scalable in terms of complexity (difficulty) as the player progresses through the game.
   * The game should be able to run on a variety of system configurations, from low-end to high-end devices, while still maintaining the same user experience.

8. **Localization and Language Support:**

   * The game should support **multiple languages** (at a minimum, English, Spanish, and French) to accommodate a global audience. Translations should be accurate and contextually appropriate for the target age group.
   * The user should be able to select their preferred language at the start of the game.

9. **Error Handling and Recovery:**

   * The game should handle potential errors gracefully. If an error occurs (e.g., loss of network connection, game crash), the game should provide an informative message and offer a way for the user to recover.
   * It should include fail-safes to prevent game crashes and data loss in case of unexpected events (e.g., user inputs, system malfunctions).

10. **Updates and Maintenance:**

    * The game should support easy updates or patches. For instance, it may need to download updates automatically or allow users to manually update the game to the latest version.
    * These updates should not interrupt gameplay in a way that negatively impacts the user experience.

### **Assumptions Made:**

* The term "headache" is interpreted as a metaphor for a problem or puzzle within the game that requires problem-solving skills.
* The game must be functional for both beginners (age 8) and advanced players (adults), so difficulty settings must be adjustable.
* The game is a standalone application, implying no need for external servers or persistent online connectivity unless explicitly stated.

With these requirements and assumptions, the development team should have a clear roadmap for building the game, with explicit guidelines for the expected user experience, system behavior, and technical performance.
